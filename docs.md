things to add to the docs:

- [ ] Chrome remote debugging only works for same version of chrome
- [ ] Chrome is old and polyfill must be provided
- [ ] while deving, services are not running as root. use `/media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/elevate-service [serviceName]`
- [ ] webos-service only for nodejs (and its api sucks)
- [ ] webosTV is in window for web apps (and its API sucks)
- [ ] still can't figure out how to debug services
- [ ] but at least can "pretend launch them" through `/usr/bin/run-js- service /media/developer/apps/usr/palm/services/com.superd22.bluetoothhid.service` to check for syntax error or wtv. Would ABSOLUTELY beneficiate from a webos-service mock locally.
